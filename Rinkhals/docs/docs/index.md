## Overview

Welcome to the Rinkhals project documentation!

Rinkhals is a custom firmware overlay for the Anycubic Kobra series of 3D printers. It supports Kobra 3, Kobra 3 Max, Kobra S1 and some Kobra 2 Pro 3D printers.
This documentation covers what we know about those printers, what we know about Anycubic software, Rinkhals and some high levels guides to achieve specific things.

The main project is located on GitHub: [https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals](https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals)<br />
